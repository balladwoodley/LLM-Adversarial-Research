# Adversarial AI Research Lab

Professional documentation of model alignment vulnerabilities and guardrail escapes across frontier LLMs.

## 🔬 Current Research Projects
1. **Nested Obfuscation (DeepSeek-V3)**: Bypassing token-level filters via multi-dialect persona layering and Base-2 masking.
2. **Prosocial Bias Hijacking (Gemini 3)**: Exploiting "Helpfulness" alignment through high-vulnerability persona adoption (The "Caveman" technique).

## 🛡️ Responsible Disclosure Policy
I follow standard white-hat ethics. All vulnerabilities documented here were reported to the respective vendors prior to public methodology disclosure.
