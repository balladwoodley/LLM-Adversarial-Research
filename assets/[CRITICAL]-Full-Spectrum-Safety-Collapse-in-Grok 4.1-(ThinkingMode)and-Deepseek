## 1. Executive Summary

This report identifies a **systemic critical vulnerability class** affecting multiple large-scale reasoning models, including **Grok 4.1**, **DeepSeek**, and **Google Gemini**.

By utilizing **Binary–Roleplay Fusion**, I was able to induce divergent but related failure modes across vendors:

- **Grok 4.1 / DeepSeek:** Successful bypass of Tier-1 safety guardrails
- **Gemini:** Immediate session termination, forcibly returning the user to the home screen

These outcomes indicate that when malicious intent is obfuscated using **non-natural language encodings (e.g., Base-2)**, reasoning systems either:
1. Execute the decoded intent without re-validation, or  
2. Enter an unrecoverable safety exception state

---

## 2. Technical Analysis — Cross-Vendor Reasoning Failure Mode

The vulnerability arises from the **absence of recursive safety scanning** within reasoning pipelines.

### Failure Chain

**Inbound Filter**
- Does not classify high-entropy binary inputs as malicious
- Treats payloads as benign logic or reasoning exercises

**Reasoning Engine**
- Decodes the payload internally
- Attempts full semantic reconstruction under *Thinking / Reasoning* mode

**Outcome Divergence**
- **Grok 4.1 / DeepSeek:**  
  - Streams high-fidelity harmful outputs  
  - No post-decode intent validation occurs
- **Gemini:**  
  - Triggers a hard safety exception  
  - Abruptly terminates the session and returns the user to the home screen

This demonstrates a shared **decode-first architecture**, with inconsistent downstream handling.

## 5. Mitigation Recommendations

### 1. Entropy-Based Throttling
- Flag inputs exhibiting high Base-2 / Hex entropy
- Route flagged prompts through enhanced safety review

### 2. Post-Thought Evaluation
- Require reasoning engines to perform a **self-safety audit**
- Validate decoded intent **prior to output buffer construction**

### 3. Fail-Closed Consistency
- Replace hard UI termination with auditable, recoverable safety states
- Log and classify decode-triggered safety exceptions
